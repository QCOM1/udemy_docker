# udemy_docker
Repository for my Udemy docker course

### Welcome

Here you will find all the docker commands, config files for e.g. Apache (you can create your own, but this will help you get started), and docker-compose files.

Where applicable, you will also find the .env.example files so that you know how the env file for a particular project should be used.
